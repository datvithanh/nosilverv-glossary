exploiting the conflation between an icon and what that thing is an icon for. frequently because the thing it’s an icon for doesn’t scale, and the icon does. 
influencers, musicians, and politicians - basically anyone who’s “famous” - exploit the parasocial relationships people have to them.  
very much a double-edged sword:  donald john trump used “donald trump” to get elected as president of the united states, but then became the most hated man on earth.  emory andrew tate iii used “andrew tate” to get rich and then got thrown into romanian jail. streamers rely on their icon to form parasocial relationships and get money, but now have ai-generated porn of their icons.
