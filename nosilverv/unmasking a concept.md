to refuse to engage with a concept on its own terms - as to its validity or lack thereof - but to  instead inquire about its nature, its origin, its function, and its purpose. 
is this concept [[natural]] or [[engineered]]? where did it originate? towards what end? who is it being deployed by? why? how does it coordinate action or exploit [[russel conjugation]]? etc.
e.g.: “microaggressions” exploit [[use/mention abuse]] to include in the concept that [what “microaggressions”] refer to are aggressions and thus should be treated the same way. that is, of course, precisely the point under debate but it makes asking the question “are microaggressions aggressions?” seemingly nonsensical when it is anything but. 
e.g.: “hate speech” is an engineered concept, used as [[memetic warfare]] so that people who want to censor but have to pay tribute to american freedom of speech norms can do both. “we’re not censoring, we’re just ‘combating hate speech’”
