the [[non-doing]] version of thinking. the [[proper referent]] of “thinking”. thoughts where a thinker isn’t obviously present, but that instead ‘naturally’ or ‘spontaneously’ occur. not intentionally willed into being. often surprising, riveting, exciting, shocking, profane, different. seem to have ‘their own agency’ and to ‘play themselves out’ of their own accord. will explore paths you usually don’t and drag you along, change you. often generates language that’s fresh, poetic, or uncommon. 
think “eureka!” vs “the thinker” - spontaneous vs deliberately willed.
