this image can be interpreted as either a duck or a rabbit. when it seems like a duck, that’s because you’re applying your ‘duck concept’ to it. when it seems like a rabbit, that’s because you’re applying your ‘rabbit concept’ to it. those concepts ‘live in you’ and your application of them changes how you interpret the stimulus. exactly the same as with clouds: your application of different concepts to them makes them seem like different things.
