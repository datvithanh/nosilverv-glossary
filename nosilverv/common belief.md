a group of people has ‘common belief’ of ‘p’ when each person in the group believes each person in the group believes each person in the group believes [sic.] ’p’. this is independent of whether they personally believe ‘p’.
e.g.: the “emperor’s new clothes” is a story about common belief and its collapse: each townsperson believes everyone else believes everyone else believes [sic.] they can see the invisible fabric, up until the moment the kid shouts the king is naked, and everyone realizes everyone else is thinking the same thing .
