#nosilverv 
applying [[emptiness]] on yourself, whatever you currently are. 
if you are your dream self, it’s becoming lucid.
if you are eaten by an ideology, it’s waking up from that.
if you are an agent that was spun for a specific purpose, it’s realising that. 
if you are that which can’t be emptied/dissolved/awoken further, then you are nibbana/buddha-nature.
