the observation that people often [[sync]] to the [[connotation]] of a [[concept]]. “becoming the mask”. effectively: becoming your condition. 
e.g.: the denotation of a “stranger” is a person who is not known in a particular place of community. the connotation is someone who’s shady, dangerous, suspicious, and untrustworthy. being treated like the first makes you feel like the second, even act like it. 
e.g.: being seen as a ‘sick’ person or up-and-coming or a “winner” or a “loser”
