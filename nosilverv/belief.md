another word for “map”. also known as “aliefs” or what you’ve “grokked”. what (you think) is. 
you believe, for example, that you’re awake, right now, reading this essay. (and you probably are, but you could be dreaming, hallucinating, in a matrix like vat, etc.). 
notably beliefs are what the world feels like.
