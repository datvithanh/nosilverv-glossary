action is something that irreversibly alters your  [[phenomenological possibilities]], by altering your [[logical possibilities]]. 
locking yourself in a new “logical world”.
it stands in contrast to ‘doing’ which is not irreversible. think about hernan cortés purposefully sinking his ships, or about getting married, as vs. having pizza for dinner.
