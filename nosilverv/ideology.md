#nosilverv 
a game in the form of an irl vr. 
created by [[sociopaths]] to organize society through broad-scale [[coordination]].
works exactly as games do: [[orients]] you by giving you a simplified version of reality that tells you without any ambiguity what’s good, what’s bad, who you are, and what your purpose is. 
the result of an [[evolutionary search process]]. (groups that chanced upon ideology as a means of coordination conquered those who didn’t.)
e.g.: the “money game”, the “work game”, “[[normalcy]]”, etc. (it is because money is a game that you can just print money, it is because jobs are a game that you can just print jobs [“bullshit jobs”], etc.)
e.g.: “you are a ea/rat/capitalist/proletarian, and what is good is to maximize utilons/qalys/shareholder value/proletariat revolutions”
