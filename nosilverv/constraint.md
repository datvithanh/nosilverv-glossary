you start out relatively unconstrained/untwisted. 
initially you can constrain and deconstraint as necessary.
eventually, due to back luck/trauma/overwhelm/etc. you can’t. this means less resources, meaning it’s more likely to happen again.
now, at some point, through grace/luck/destiny/faith/emptiness/cessation/realization(/this document?) the possibility and ability to deconstraint emerges as an explicit object and you can start doing it, all the way back, all the way back and out including to the original-constraint-you-never-even-knew-was-a-constraint. this is going dan mode. breaking out and back all the way. enlightenment.
