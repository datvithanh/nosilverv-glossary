think of it this way: how weird would it be for someone to have a new years resolution to “do more drugs” or someone who was trying to get themselves to (trying to get themselves to) smoke at least a blunt every day or for someone to deliberately intend to perform badly? really weird, right? because those are things that ‘just happen’, correct? so the ‘just happen’ is the referent i’m pointing to.
in one you’re emulating the relevant action, in the other you’re just being/vibing/existing and that happens to be in a way that other people would call writing, or thinking, or dancing, or whatever the “official name” for the “action you are doing” is. but, importantly, your intention is not “do [action]”. it’s something else, but not that. it just happens to be described as having been “doing [action]” retrospectively, but that doesn’t mean that that was the intention you held while engaged in it. 
not acting out an ‘idea’ or a ‘model’ but just acting and letting verbal models of what that acting was be constructed post-facto. 
really deep confusion about causality and intention: you don’t intend to do action and then action happens. you intend a goal state and then actions occur towards that goal state.
