sun tzu said “all warfare is based on deception”. the best war, hence, is the one the enemy doesn’t even know is being fought. thus, inimical action often hides. (making it harder to create a schelling point to coordinate against it). therefore, it must be inferred to. 
there are heuristics that help in making these inferences.
e.g.:  ““once is happenstance. twice is coincidence. three times is enemy action”.  
e.g.: “quo vadis?” which is latin for “who benefits?”
