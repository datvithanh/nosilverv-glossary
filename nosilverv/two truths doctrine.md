the expression of a belief that is wrong in an ultimate sense but correct in a local sense. doing with the intention of leading people to a view that is more right or less wrong than what they had before, even if itâ€™s not perfectly accurate, or precise. 
e.g.: believing, in a country where people drive left, that driving left is ultimately right. this belief is ultimately wrong in that there is no such thing as the ultimately right way of driving, but it is locally right: it gets you to work without crashing into someone else.
