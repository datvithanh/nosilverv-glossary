#nosilverv 
a platform that spreads [[ideology]]. 
works because people don’t realize they’re fabricated, not a depiction of reality, and, like with vr, reflexively [[merge]]. 
what augustine said holds as true of media as of dreams: you first believe, then you understand (i.e. can question). the default is to believe, else it wouldn’t work. 
suspension of disbelief.
vr.
media.
it enters [[fluently]] and it takes [[disfluency]] to question it.
