the name of something and that something itself are two distinct things.
this is revealed by the fact that you can change something’s name without changing what it is, as revealed by the fact that the same thing has different names in different languages.
this seems obvious but people mess this up all the time. (see russel conjugation)
another way people mess this up is by thinking of a thing through its name rather than its properties or parts. this also seems obvious but gets exploited because it works. see people who try to understand a thing by looking at its name or the composition of names it is constituted by (“domestic terrorists” exploit this, but also etymological analysis, or the dominant picture theory of language in philosophy - the idea you can ‘read off’ facts about objects, from the language used to refer to them).
