behavioral rigidity and inflexibility. a consequence of excessive [[agential layering]]. to be expected as each agent is an emulation being ran by the agent who spun it, and thus only has a portion of their resources available. 
the more agents someone has iteratively spun, i.e. the more ‘layered’ they are, the less behavioral flexibility they have.
imagine a balloon getting very twisted upon itself:

in extremis you get an ‘npc’ - someone with shockingly little behavioral flexibility, whose behavior, beliefs, and opinions are fungible with everyone else who is as layered as them.
