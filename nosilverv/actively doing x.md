making yourself do x. 
via actively willing to make x happen, while feeling as the originator of that action, instead of letting or allowing it to spontaneously happen, or emerge. 
e.g: “doing thinking”, “doing writing”.
e.g. “stop trying to hit me and hit me” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvzgrhbygho 
e.g.: using a robot arm to control itself instead of just using the robot arm
