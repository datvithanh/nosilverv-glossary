technically correct statements that intend to [[induce in mistake]]. either via implication or omission or by answering the literal question asked instead of the spirit of the question. done a lot by lawyers, politicians.
e.g.: saying that two companies are “not the same” because they’re distinct legal entities when in fact all the same people work in both companies, in the same roles, and they’re piloted by the same person.
