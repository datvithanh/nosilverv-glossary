deliberately conflating two terms under one name. 
might be done for pro-social/positive-sum reasons [[two truths]] or for anti-social/mixed- or negative-sum reasons 
prime-target for [[rectification of names]].
deliberately using the same word while meaning different things to paint one’s opponent as clinically insane to one’s base. a tool for [[memetic warfare]]
e.g.: in  both people paints the other one as crazy: as if one were claiming that transmen can’t get pregnant (objectively false) and the other that [cis] men can get pregnant (objectively false). 
e.g.: using “normal” to deliberately conflate a behavior that is judged to be “good” with a behavior that is judged to be “common” in an attempt to get people who [[sync to common belief]] to [[sync]] to it. 
e.g. “black lives matter” (the statement) and “black lives matter” (the org). it seemed for a bit that not being pro the org was the same as disagreeing with the statement.
