using knowledge as a defense against acting. acting gives you feedback from the world that confronts you with who you are and thus threatens your self image ([[map]] of yourself).
the spirit is “i know, therefore i don’t have to do”. a conscious increase of learned helplessness/loss of agency by growing one’s circle of concern while keeping one’s circle of influence static. 
deliberately adding to the map at the expense of confronting/getting intimate with the territory. 
usually done in groups that self-validate.
