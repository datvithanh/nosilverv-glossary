a decision is when you deliberately alter your [[logical possibilities]] by changing your [[phenomenological possibilities]]. 
the resolve to stably not go a certain way or to go exactly a kind of way at the exclusion of all others. 
locking yourself in a new “phenomenological world”.
it stands in contrast with ‘choosing’ which has you choose from predetermined options and leaves you inside the same phenomenological world.
