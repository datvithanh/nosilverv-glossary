defined negatively as the distinct state of lacking a clear orientation. 
it matters because it can be both natural or deliberately caused and because comfort with it varies. some people’s threshold for it is so small that they’ll panic and [[subordinate]] to anything that is present to them in that state, so long as it orients them.
this is how a pattern interrupt can be used to disorient a person so that they’ll follow your narrative (https://www.facebook.com/reel/486893523644388), how magicians do snap-induction hypnosis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtf5usqhrka), and how [[sociopaths]] can get a group to shift their [[ideology]] en masse, all at once.
