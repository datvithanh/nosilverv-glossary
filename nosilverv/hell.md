#nosilverv 
a phenomenological place characterized by total lack of orientation. either because nothing seems possible -- i.e.: no overlap between [[logical and phenomenological possibilities]]) -- or everything does -- i.e. perfect overlap between [[logical and phenomenological possibilities]])

in the former nothing is ready-at-hand, in the latter everything is present-to-hand. both are maximally [[anti-agentic]] states. 
to know nothing is total impotence, but so is to know everything. omniscience = impotence (at least for humans). part of why smart people often flail: seeing too many options they get stuck in considering. explosion. a perfect brain with no effectuators. god without a physical extension. dead emperor. 
those that see less have only a few avenues to act, and do so.
