exploiting the common tendency to conflate the name of a thing with what that thing is. 
an instance of using [[fluency/disfluency]] to lead thought down some path and not others. 
e.g.: calling certain institutions “non-governmental organizations” to make the questions like “are non-governmental organizations connected to governments?” harder to generate and to parse. 
e.g.: “love is just a word”. (no: the word “love” is just a word) 
e.g.: “meat-free burger”
